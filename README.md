:cyclone: Credit risk project https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908?permalink_comment_id=5102128#gistcomment-5102128
This is a project that used  machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm). Based on the ENAHO database, a classification was made of the characteristics of people who had received credit and those who had not. Then, an algorithm was created to detect the risk of a person not being approved for credit based on certain characteristics.
